/**
 * A general implementation of the BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm.
 * <p>
 * The input is a directed graph (implicitly defined by a neighbor provider function) and one or more source nodes.
 * The nodes of the graph often represent different states of a puzzle, and the directed edges represent the feasible
 * steps. The neighbor provider function has to provide for each node {@code u} the collection of neighbor nodes
 * reachable form {@code u} via directed edges.
 * <p>
 * A target predicate can also be specified in order to find path to a single node instead of all nodes.
 * The algorithm terminates when a shortest path is found for at least one target node (more precisely, for each
 * target node having minimum distance). This way, we can search paths even in an infinite graph of feasible states
 * and steps.

 * @see ShortestPath
