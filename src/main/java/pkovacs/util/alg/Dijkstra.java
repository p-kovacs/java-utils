/**
 * Implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a> for
 * finding shortest paths.
 * <p>
 * The input is a directed graph with long integer edge weights (implicitly defined by an edge provider function)
 * and one or more source nodes. The edge provider function has to provide for each node {@code u} a collection of
 * (node, weight) pairs ({@link Edge} objects) describing the outgoing directed edges of {@code u}. This function
 * is applied at most once for each node, when the algorithm advances from that node.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm only supports non-negative edge weights. If you need negative weights as well, use
 * {@link ShortestPath} instead.
 * <p>
 * A target predicate can also be specified in order to find path to a single node instead of all nodes.
 * The algorithm terminates when a shortest path is found for at least one target node (more precisely, for each
 * target node having minimum distance). This way, paths can be searched even in an infinite graph provided that
 * the edges are generated on-the-fly when requested by the algorithm. For example, nodes and edges might represent
 * feasible states and steps of a combinatorial problem, and we might not know or do not want to enumerate all
 * possible states in advance.
 *
 * @see Bfs
 * @see ShortestPath
